This SQL code cleans and transforms data in the NashvilleHousing table. It standardizes the date format, populates missing property addresses, splits address information into individual columns, and converts "Y" and "N" values to "Yes" and "No" in the SoldAsVacant column. Additionally, it removes duplicate rows and deletes unused columns, resulting in a cleaner and more structured dataset.
